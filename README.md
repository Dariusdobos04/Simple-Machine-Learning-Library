Java Binary Classification Library with JavaFX GUI


This project is a lightweight machine learning library developed in Java, focused on binary classification. It includes implementations of fundamental classification algorithms such as Perceptron, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Na√Øve Bayes, with support for training, testing, and evaluation on custom datasets.

Initially started as an academic exercise, the project evolved into a modular and extensible library that incorporates key Java concepts including object-oriented design, interfaces, generics, Java 8 Streams, functional interfaces, and serialization.

üì¶ Features
Dataset handling: Load datasets from CSV files or other input streams

Model training & testing: Built-in support for training models and evaluating their performance on test sets

Evaluation metrics: Includes Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and confusion matrix for model assessment

Model serialization: Save and load trained models using Java I/O streams

Functional design: Utilizes Java functional interfaces and streams for cleaner and more efficient processing

üéõÔ∏è JavaFX GUI
The project also includes a user-friendly JavaFX-based graphical interface, which allows:

Selection of input datasets (e.g., Pima Indians Diabetes dataset)

Choosing a classifier and tuning its hyperparameters

Setting the train/test split ratio

Visualizing classification results, including evaluation metrics and confusion matrix
